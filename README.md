# Restock
### Features
- Web Gui

### Description 
### Purpose
This system is designed to be used by the administration of a shop, which needs to take big orders from stockists before ending the stock.
But there are differents stockists which sell the same products with differents shipping time, differents prices and differents promotion. 
Starting from this scenario we need to create a system which allows to search the product which we want to buy and compare all the suppliers with their prices  and their shipping time and sort them for the best one.
### Technology
The system is going to run with the usage of some different technologies: for the database, we are going to use MySQL, for the app itself we are going to use NodeJS with HTML5, CSS and Javascript . For the interface, we used a CSS library called Bootstrap.
